  <p>With the steady increase in incoming work, we’ve been looking for multiple new additions for the Cargo team. We’re pleased to say we’ve found some and this week we’re shouting about Laura-Jane, our new digital marketing executive!</p>

  <h3>Who are you?</h3>
  <p>Laura-Jane Todd</p>

  <h3>Where are you from?</h3>
  <p>Cramlington</p>

  <h3>What experience are you bringing to Cargo?</h3>
  <p>I spent some time volunteering on the St Oswald’s marketing and comms team whilst at university before specialising in digital marketing at a large North East agency where I worked for almost two years. My role involved creating on-site and off-site copy and helping deliver digital marketing strategies for a range of clients.</p>

  <h3>What are you looking forward to achieving at Cargo?</h3>

  <p>I’m looking forward to being involved with creating some exciting digital marketing strategies and getting to know the clients.</p>

  <h3>What do you enjoy doing outside of work?</h3>

  <p>When I’m not at work I’m usually listening to podcasts, catching up on the latest binge-worthy shows on Netflix, discovering food places around Newcastle and travelling to new places.</p>

  <h3>How have you found your first two weeks at Cargo?</h3>

  <p>Everyone at Cargo has been very welcoming and made me feel part of the team!</p>

  <h3>How is your Great North Run training going and who are you running for?</h3>

  <p>Following a few initial injuries, it’s going well! I’m running with my friend, we’re up to ten miles with a week to go and we’ve reached our fundraising target. I’m raising money for St Oswald’s Hospice who provide amazing support for those living with incurable conditions and their families which is keeping me motivated.</p>
