<p>With the steady increase in incoming work, we’ve been looking for multiple new additions for the Cargo team. We’re pleased to say we’ve found some and this week we’re shouting about Matt, our new front-end developer!</p>

<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>Matthew Oliver Proctor</p>

<h3>Where are you from?</h3>
<p>Coventry</p>

<h3>What experience are you bringing to Cargo?</h3>
<p>I am bringing a varied knowledge base to the role having worked with clients of different sizes in a multitude of sectors. I have created websites for FedEx/TNT and The Heart of England Co-operative, along with helping small business establish their online presences and I am sure this will prove valuable to our upcoming projects.</p>

<h3>What are you looking forward to achieving at Cargo?</h3>

<p>I am looking forward being part of the Cargo team creating amazing web sites for our clients and their customers. I am also hoping to create innovative interactive experiences by developing my skills through hard work and learning new technologies. </p>

<h3>What do you enjoy doing outside of work?</h3>

<p>Outside of work I am a huge comedy and sports fan. I also love to travel, visiting different cultures and experiencing new adventures while sampling whatever local food and drink is on offer as I go.</p>

<h3>How have you found your first two weeks at Cargo?</h3>

<p>The Cargo team as a whole have been very friendly and welcoming.</p>

<h3>How do you think Cov is going to perform this season?</h3>

<p>If the first couple of games are anything to go by we are in for a good season, but knowing Coventry we will be in the playoffs at Christmas and in a relegation fight come May. It’s a painful existence supporting The Sky Blues but hopefully this season will be the light at the end of a very long tunnel.</p>
